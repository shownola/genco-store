            <p>Genco Pura was a front for the Corleone crime family's criminal activities and its more shady operations were carried out by Salvatore Tessio and Peter Clemenza. The company became incredibly successful during the 1930s, after defeating Salvatore Maranzano in an event that would later be known as the Olive Oil War, named after the company.</p>
